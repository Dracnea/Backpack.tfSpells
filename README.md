# Team Fortress 2 Search Scripts
This script is to be used on backpack.tf with Tampermonkey in order to help make spelled items from the game Team Fortess 2 quickly visible to the eye. The script will both add color and text content to an given spelled item instance thus saving search time for any given user.<br/><br/>
This script works on the classified, premium search, and user profile pages.

## Paid For Features

If you would like to inquire about the paid version please <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracnea">add me on Steam.</a> You must leave a comment.<br/><br/>
The paid version will automatically search through all pages on the backpack.tf premium tool and return every spelled instance in a neat and clean single tab.<br/><br/>
This version is not free due to the fact that it can become a powerful tool used to gather data on both items and individuals, and thus can be used for the wrong reasons.
